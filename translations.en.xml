With impressive boosts to damage and health stats, it is necessary to upgrade all of your turrets to Level 17 in order to maintain your dominance on Cerulea IV!

Second, from now on, turrets do not require an Incendiary Core for Level 1 builds!  This means that you can build Level 1 Incendiary Turrets, Sniper Towers, Heavyweight Turrets, Corrosive Turrets and Anti-Tank Turrets without an Incendiary Core!

Start building and upgrading these turrets today to make your base the strongest in all of Edgeworld!

No longer will your mine detonate on impact, and has become a permanent structure and part of your base defense!  The attack power of these Mines has also been increased with each upgrade level, granting you even more bang for your buck above any other single turret in the game! 

The requirements for building Neutron Mines will remain the same, so make sure to check them out if you have a Level 9 or higher factory...and if you don't, what are you waiting for?  Build and upgrade your mines today before your enemies take advantage! </message.body.20121029neutronmine>

  <message.body.20121031reliefcrate>Hey all,

We here at Kabam have been watching closely as the destruction and tragedies of Hurricane Sandy have been unfolding on the East Coast. We have also been moved by the compassion and response demonstrated by the efforts to raise money in support of the relief and aid of those affected. In support of these efforts and in response to this disaster, Edgeworld, as well as other Kabam games, will be collecting donations through the sale of Relief items.

We will be making available in the shop a "Sandy Relief Crate" which will contain the following items:

3x Decimator Racks, 3x 30% Training Accelerators, and 5x Zoot's Minigame Tokens!

100% of the net proceeds received from the mystery box sales will go towards the Red Cross for Hurricane Relief Charity.

When all sales are complete, we will make the donation to the Red Cross on the behalf of the Kabam Community and Kabam, Inc., to the victims of Hurricane Sandy. We hope that you will join us in this effort to raise donations for those affected by this tragedy.

Thank you,

The Edgeworld Team
Kabam, Inc.</message.body.20121031reliefcrate>

  <message.body.20130222smartpart2>Two new powerful parts have been made available for the Engineering Lab, Cerulean Damage Sensors and Cerulean Central Protection Parts!  

Cerulean Damage Sensors will greatly increase your turret's Range and Damage but that's not all!  These parts come equipped with a "Smart" AI that will cause your turrets to target units with the "lowest" health, almost assuredly finishing them off. 

Cerulean Central Protection parts will greatly increase Splash Radius and provide multi-targeting capabilities, but once again there's more.  The Central Protection's Smart AI will automatically switch to and target any units that take a shot towards your command center, further aiding in your base defense

The only way to acquire these items are through our new Smart Part Mystery Crate!  This crate will not only give you a chance to take home this new premium part, but can also net you other great items like General SP Racks and Hacker's Patches!

  <message.body.20130604enhancetokenrelease>Today we are happy to announce the launch of an exciting new feature, Engineering Lab Part Enhancements! Now you will have the ability to further customize your Engineering Lab Parts and by extension your base defenses to further combat your enemies in Edgeworld.

What exactly are Enhancements?

Enhancements are additional bonuses that can be applied to your existing Engineering Lab Parts through the use of new "Enhancement Tokens". Each Lab part now will have 2 available Enhancement Slots, so if you fill these slots your existing parts will instantly become more powerful!

These Enhancement Tokens will not provide flat bonuses, however, but are tied to the Upgrade level of the Engineering Lab part it is attached to. This means that these bonuses will scale along with the upgrade level of the part, and will increase just like any normal part stat.

Here are the steps to take in order to get started:

1. Visit the "Parts" tab within your Engineering Lab and left click on the desired Engineering Lab Part to bring up the item menu
2. Select the new "Enhancements" option
3. Here you will see a list of Enhancement Tokens you either own or are able to purchase. Click on the desired token and click "Enhance" to add the effect to your Engineering Lab Part!
4. Now you can view the extra stats that have been added to your part, and once equipped will instantly increase your defense!

How can you get your hands on these new tokens? Currently there are 2 ways!

1. 3 basic tokens will initially be available for purchase in the Enhancement Screen of each part.
-Armor Token - Applies a small scaling Health Boost
-Piercing Ammo Token - Applies a small scaling Damage Boost
-Explosive Ammo Token - Applies a small scaling Boost to Splash Radius

2. In addition to these basic tokens, 5 others will be available through the Wheel Game! These following 5 possess a higher power level then the previous 3 listed:
-Armor Token 2.0 - Applies a larger scaling Health Boost
-Piercing Ammo Token 2.0 - Applies a larger scaling Damage Boost
-Explosive Ammo Token 2.0 - Applies a larger scaling Boost to Splash Radius
-Scope Token - Applies a bonus to the part's Range
-Liquid Coolant - Applies a bonus to the part's Attacks per Minute</message.body.20130604enhancetokenrelease>

  <message.body.20120831pyroevent>Zoot claims to have possibly found an....unsavory....way to reproduce a valuable piece of Cerulean Technology--the Incendiary Core.

This involves the remains of a Pyro that has died in a very particular way--Horribly.

In order to make this experiment a success, he needs visual evidence in order to confirm which Pyros met the criteria.

Respond to this thread with screenshots and video captures of the most savage, gruesome display of...test subjects.

Zoot will open up his stockpiles and provide a Cerulean Rack to the five commanders who provide the best material as well as their Name and Sector before Friday, September 7th at 12:00pm PST

Disclaimer: Submissions become the property of Zoot in order for research purposes, and possibly an intergalactic pay-per-view event.

The first Overlord of the Sector will be designated at 12:01am PST on August 1st, so be sure to have the most Force in your sector by then!

  <message.body.valentine2013start>Commander,

Thanks to Vukice&#8217;s understanding of the Erazi communications network, I&#8217;ve been able to intercept high level Syndicate communications. I have something you'll be quite interested in.

Scyllith has a secret meeting with Grod of the Helio Legion coming up soon. It appears they've been having regular meetings for the past two months. There is no word on what they will be meeting to discuss, only that they will be in person, and alone.  We need to find out what this meeting is about! If the Helio and Erazi were to combine forces, it could change the landscape of the war and not in a way we'd like.

The Secret Location is being monitored for security by an unspecified Erazi Base.  We have only one option: Hit every Erazi Base we can, and plunder their Datastores until we find the right one!</message.body.valentine2013start>

  <message.body.20130222spacedragons>Commander,

We have just received an urgent warning transmission from a nearby galaxy.  It appears that a new synthetic species, known only as the Incineraptor, has been destroying colony after colony as it makes its way across the universe.  The Incineraptors attack in large numbers and are extraordinarily dangerous.  Unfortunately, they are now headed directly at us and show no sign of slowing down. 

Our only chance for survival is to attack them head-on through the defense simulator, sir.  These may be the most challenging battles that we have ever fought, but I have faith that we will be victorious in the end. </message.body.20130222spacedragons>

In the meantime, we have enabled the ability to link your Google+ game account to Kabam.com. For more information on how to do this, click &lt;a href="http://community.kabam.com/forums/showthread.php?176407-How-to-Link-Your-Google-Game-Account-to-Kabam-com" target="_blank"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;

We will be deleting all duplicate and excess (and non-equipped) Level 1 Basic Lab parts, then instituting a cap of 100 max parts within Engineering Labs. 

This change should not only address an error that has affected many users within their labs, but should also improve overall game performance as well!

Again, we will be performing this maintenance on Wednesday November 7th, so make sure to get your Engineering Lab in order!  This action will not require any server downtime, so your gameplay shouldn't be interrupted.

  <message.body.20130124generalrelease>The Helio Defector, General Mako has joined your cause, and with it comes his technical prowess.  Each General&#8217;s Power Armor has been augmented with new abilities!

General Strom gets the Plasma Cannon, a devastating AoE explosion that can eventually be fired at range.

General Vukice gets the Magnetic Shield, a Buff for himself and troops that provides a temporary resistance to munitions based weapons, similar to a Berserker.

Mako himself gets the Overdrive ability, giving the affected troops a short term, but sizable upgrade in damage.

These abilities aren&#8217;t part of a general&#8217;s normal repertoire, and thus require a General&#8217;s Order to be able to train and upgrade. Keep an eye out for opportunities to get your hands on this valuable item!

1. Map nodes can now be upgraded to a maximum level of 50,000.  Map nodes that are captured by an opposing player will only lose 25% of their levels.

2. Alliances can now hold a maximum of 10,000 nodes.  Alliances that currently control more than 10,000 nodes cannot take control of more nodes until they fall below this 10,000 node maximum.

3. The Alliance doubling bonus from holding the maximum number of nodes has been removed.

4. All level requirements for attacking nodes have been removed.

The Maar Confederacy was once a mutually beneficial alliance between the sovereign world governments. But when the Cerulean threat nearly destroyed civilization, the Confederacy changed from a benevolent partnership to a martial dictatorship.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Maar Confederacy still believes that every base on Cerulea IV is rightfully part of the Confederacy, and owes them loyalty and taxes. Their aggression is a threat to the societies and economies of planets across the galaxy.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Helio Legion and the Erazi Syndicate don't deny the growing Maar threat. In fact, they're willing to provide some 'assistance' to three Commanders in each Sector who prove the most disruptive to Maar operations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;One Commander Level 1 to 100:&lt;/b&gt; 250,000 Energy, 250,000 Uranium, 1 Combat Strategy
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;One Commander Level 101 to 500:&lt;/b&gt; 1 million Energy, 1 million Uranium, 2 Combat Strategies
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;One Commander Level 501 and up:&lt;/b&gt; 4 million Energy, 4 million Uranium, 3 Combat Strategies
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
To win, launch as many attacks as possible against Maar bases between 12:00 Saturday morning to 12:00 Monday night (PST)!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Picking on weaklings isn't sporting - only battles against bases that are at least 1/2 your level will count!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href-"http://community.kabam.com/forums/showthread.php?49778"&gt;Details and full rules are in the forums!&lt;/a&gt; Let the battle begin!

Remember when I told you that we had a safe and environmentally sound way of disposing of our research chemicals?  About that...

The Terraknor may or may not have all died off due to some sort of chemical induced illness. We're lucky that the chemicals had a different effect on one of the other local creatures. They've become huge, and aggressive. 

I call them "Lancers".

We should be able to use our old Control Devices to weaponize these new creatures, assuming we survive their initial assault. 
Get to the Defense Simulator. Break them.</message.body.20121029terraknor>

My Spies have intercepted some enemy cargo, and its contents are ours for the taking!  What's the catch you may ask Commander?  It's information is encrypted, and guess who has the key?  

Zoot, of course!  

Starting today, you'll begin to see various encrypted boxes start dropping from the Defense Sim.  If you snag one of these boxes bring it to me and I can unlock its contents...for a small fee of course!

We have spotted an unidentified aircraft near our borders. This craft bears no resemblance to any current Union technology. Historical records show greatest semblance to an earth land vessel known as a &#8220;sleigh&#8221;.

This craft was shot down by Maar forces, but our troops were able to rescue the pilot.  Our troops couldn&#8217;t identify the pilot due to extensive injuries, but the pilot was reported as being&#8230;rotund&#8230;and wearing a peculiar red hat. We have placed the pilot in a regeneration chamber, but we will be unable to learn more about the pilot until they are fully healed.

Faction forces are advancing on our position. I believe they want to capture the pilot!  Get to the defense simulator and protect the base!</message.body.redsleighbegin>

  <message.monocerosmaps.body>Thanks to your vocal support in the forums, Monoceros has been selected as the next Sector to receive the territorial map!
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The map is still a work in progress, and as such, there may still be bugs and issues to work through. Please send us your bug reports with the 'Help' link above the game window.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We're still working on the rules of the territorial map, and testing the results. There may be numerous changes over the next few weeks, and we appreciate your patience and your feedback!
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Because the map is still under development, it's possible that we'll need to take the map down temporarily to fix issues or improve features. We don't expect to have any map downtime, but if we do, we'll make it as short as possible.

If ya did, you&#8217;re a real mensch, and you should check your inventory, because I left ya a gift.

There it is. Don&#8217;t ever let it be said that old Zoot never gave you anything. You know, except for a random item EVERY. FREAKING. DAY.

Anyway, when you&#8217;re done kicking some poor sod&#8217;s teeth in, you should swing by my place.  I might have something special for you&#8230;or not!  You&#8217;ll just have to see.

  <zootsjackpot.description>&lt;font color="FFD93F"&gt;How to Play Zoot's Jackpot:&lt;/font&gt;

Click play to start the game.

After each round, you have a chance of landing on four types of tiles.

&lt;font color="FFD93F"&gt;Prize:&lt;/font&gt; you may choose to either CLAIM or RISK the prize to play the next row. Each row contains more valuable prizes and better Jackpot odds, but also has a higher chance of landing on a Skull.

&lt;font color="FFD93F"&gt;Platinum:&lt;/font&gt; you enter the Platinum Round. In the Platinum Round, you may choose 10 tiles. You win the total of all the Platinum contained in these 10 tiles!

&lt;font color="FFD93F"&gt;JACKPOT:&lt;/font&gt; you win the Progressive Platinum Jackpot! Every game play increases the Jackpot and each Jackpot win resets the counter.

&lt;font color="FFD93F"&gt;Skull:&lt;/font&gt; you receive a consolation prize and the game ends.

Each game costs 25 Platinum to play. Playing higher rows does not cost additional Platinum, but you run the risk of losing your prize. 

The game ends after a prize is claimed, at the conclusion of a Platinum Round, after a Jackpot win or after landing on a Skull. </zootsjackpot.description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governor Maalick of the Confederacy has publicly denounced the actions of the Erazi Syndicate, calling them the largest and most powerful criminal organization in the galaxy. (Which is completely true.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Maar Confederacy has created a program of subsidies, tax cuts, and bonus items for the Commanders who help them gain revenge on the Erazi Syndicate.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To win, destroy as many Erazi Command Centers as you can from 12:00 Saturday morning to 11:59 Monday night! (PST, 6am GMT). 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every Commander who achieves these goals will win these items - the Maar aren't leaving anything to chance.

Remember when I told you that we had a safe and environmentally sound way of disposing of our research chemicals?  About that...

The Terraknor may or may not have all died off due to some sort of chemical induced illness. We're lucky that the chemicals had a different effect on one of the other local creatures. They've become huge, and aggressive. 

I call them "Lancers".

We should be able to use our old Control Devices to weaponize these new creatures, assuming we survive their initial assault. 
Get to the Defense Simulator.

  <message.body.20130213makegood>Earlier this afternoon, due to issues with our external data center provider many kabam.com games including Edgeworld experienced an outage of approximately two hours. Though these issues were largely out of our own control, we deeply sympathize with the many players who were inconvenienced by the outage. Please find in your inventory: one Bomba Box and one of the NEW and Improved Kira's Gifts as a small token of appreciation to you, our players, for your patience and continued loyalty to Edgeworld.

We sincerely apologize to all of our affected players and will do our best to minimize these types of issues going forward. THANK YOU all for choosing to play our game!
