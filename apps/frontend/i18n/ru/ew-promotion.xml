The Maar Confederacy was once a mutually beneficial alliance between the sovereign world governments. But when the Cerulean threat nearly destroyed civilization, the Confederacy changed from a benevolent partnership to a martial dictatorship.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Maar Confederacy still believes that every base on Cerulea IV is rightfully part of the Confederacy, and owes them loyalty and taxes. Their aggression is a threat to the societies and economies of planets across the galaxy.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Helio Legion and the Erazi Syndicate don't deny the growing Maar threat. In fact, they're willing to provide some 'assistance' to three Commanders in each Sector who prove the most disruptive to Maar operations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;One Commander Level 1 to 100:&lt;/b&gt; 250,000 Energy, 250,000 Uranium, 1 Combat Strategy
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;One Commander Level 101 to 500:&lt;/b&gt; 1 million Energy, 1 million Uranium, 2 Combat Strategies
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;One Commander Level 501 and up:&lt;/b&gt; 4 million Energy, 4 million Uranium, 3 Combat Strategies
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
To win, launch as many attacks as possible against Maar bases between 12:00 Saturday morning to 12:00 Monday night (PST)!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Picking on weaklings isn't sporting - only battles against bases that are at least 1/2 your level will count!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

        <target>We must improve our knowledge of the terrible Lancer!

Upgrade your Lancer Research by Monday, and you could win!

We're giving out one prize to a random player in each Sector for each level of Research:

Level 1: Combat Skill&lt;br&gt;Level 2: Combat Tactics&lt;br&gt;Level 3: Combat Strategy&lt;br&gt;Level 4: Combat Strategy x2&lt;br&gt;Level 5: Combat Strategy x3&lt;br&gt;Level 6: Combat Strategy x4&lt;br&gt;Level 7: Combat Strategy x5&lt;br&gt;Level 8: Combat Strategy x5 + Warrior's Kit&lt;br&gt;Level 9: Combat Strategy x5 + Master's Kit

Increase your Research to be eligible for higher prizes.

(Also, fewer players have high-level Research, so your chances to win are better, too!)

Prizes are awarded Monday, November 7. Good luck! Click on your Tech Lab and start your research!</target>

        <target>&lt;img src="http://i39.tinypic.com/ih76tt.jpg"&gt;The Maar Confederacy was pushed to the brink of destruction, but they've bounced back with surprising strength. Where are their resources coming from?
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governor Maalick of the Confederacy has publicly denounced the actions of the Erazi Syndicate, calling them the largest and most powerful criminal organization in the galaxy. (Which is completely true.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Maar Confederacy has created a program of subsidies, tax cuts, and bonus items for the Commanders who help them gain revenge on the Erazi Syndicate.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To win, destroy as many Erazi Command Centers as you can from 12:00 Saturday morning to 11:59 Monday night! (PST, 6am GMT). 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every Commander who achieves these goals will win these items - the Maar aren't leaving anything to chance.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10 attacks: 1000 Crystal and Gas
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;25 attacks: 50,000 Crystal and Gas
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;50 attacks: 100,000 Crystal and Gas
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;75 attacks: 250,000 Crystal and Gas
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;100 attacks: 1,000,000 Crystal and Gas
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;150 attacks: 4,000,000 Crystal and Gas
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;250 attacks: 20,000,000 Crystal and Gas&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://community.kabam.com/forums/showthread.php?50907" target="_blank"&gt;Details and full rules are in the forums!&lt;/a&gt; Show the Erazi your might!&lt;/p&gt;</target>
