        <target>&lt;font color="FFD93F"&gt;How to Play Zoot's Jackpot:&lt;/font&gt;

Click play to start the game.

After each round, you have a chance of landing on four types of tiles.

&lt;font color="FFD93F"&gt;Prize:&lt;/font&gt; you may choose to either CLAIM or RISK the prize to play the next row. Each row contains more valuable prizes and better Jackpot odds, but also has a higher chance of landing on a Skull.

&lt;font color="FFD93F"&gt;Platinum:&lt;/font&gt; you enter the Platinum Round. In the Platinum Round, you may choose 10 tiles. You win the total of all the Platinum contained in these 10 tiles!

&lt;font color="FFD93F"&gt;JACKPOT:&lt;/font&gt; you win the Progressive Platinum Jackpot! Every game play increases the Jackpot and each Jackpot win resets the counter.

&lt;font color="FFD93F"&gt;Skull:&lt;/font&gt; you receive a consolation prize and the game ends.

Each game costs 25 Platinum to play. Playing higher rows does not cost additional Platinum, but you run the risk of losing your prize. 

The game ends after a prize is claimed, at the conclusion of a Platinum Round, after a Jackpot win or after landing on a Skull. </target>
